        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I currently work at a web design company customizing frameworks built on their proprietary platform. I've found it is easier to modify the frameworks using code instead of the platform, which was intriguing. As a result, I'd like to get into front-end web design.</p>
      
        <p>Prior to working in web design, I’ve been a restaurant server, police dispatcher and crime scene investigator. While they were very interesting jobs, they tend to make you view the dark side of life. I left that behind to do something creative and I really enjoy it so far.</p>
		
	  	<p>In addition to working in varied industries, I have also moved around a lot and studied numerous fields. I’m excited to see where my next journey takes me... hopefully Seattle. Go Hawks.</p>
